\chapter{Conclusion}

This project has proved that it is possible to create a novel programming environment for novices, utilising commonplace and eminently accessible technologies to provide a rich graphical representation of the state of the machine. I have demonstrated that such a tool does not yet exist despite the work that others have put into programming education systems. I have shown that my design can create such a system, and that it is possible to be implemented in a solid and reliable way. My implementation has been able to rely solely on free and open source software and frameworks, so that it may fulfil the goal of widening access to programming education for minimal or zero cost. The two toy languages that I have created demonstrate that the tool provides a platform for educators to write their own for their own teaching purposes. In addition, it has become very clear that there is a significant amount of potential for this tool to improve teaching of a wide range of computer science topics. There is plenty more that can be done to make this tool even better in future without diminishing its initial utility for novice programmers.
