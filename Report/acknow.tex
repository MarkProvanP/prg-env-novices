I would like to thank Edwin Brady for supervising me in this project. He has assisted me greatly as I transformed a few scattered ideas drawn from Lamdu and Learnable Programming by Brett Victor into a full senior honours project. It has been a pleasure to meet with him every week to discuss my progress and my next steps. It was very encouraging to see his own final year undergraduate project and how mine is in essence a modern continuation of the same basic idea of using computers to teach computer science.

I would also like to thank the School of Computer Science for accommodating me over the past four years. As I have gone on record in the university prospectus to say, my time at St Andrews has been the happiest of my entire life. The School has given me the knowledge and skills that I will be using for the rest of my life to improve the world through the medium of computation.

Finally, I would like to thank my parents for raising me to become the person I am today. I could not have got here without their unconditional love and support.
